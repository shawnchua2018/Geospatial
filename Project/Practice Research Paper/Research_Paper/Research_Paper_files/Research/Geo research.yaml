    In Singapore, the public resale housing market is an active second-hand
    housing market, whereby previously subsidised new public housing units were
    being transacted at market prices. In contrast to the private housing price
    determinants that have been identified in the international literature, the
    prices of public resale housing in Singapore are largely determined by
    public policies rather than by economic variables. This paper provides some
    empirical evidence on how and to what degree public housing policies
    affected the price dynamics of public resale housing in Singapore during the
    1990s. The findings have additional implications of the wider consequences
    of public policies on the prices of private housing units.

    In recent decades, modeling house prices has become a hot topic among
    economists, planners, and policymakers due to the significant role of
    properties in household wealth and national economy. As many existing
    hedonic pricing models fail to take into account the effect of local spatial
    variations on the housing prices, there has been an increasing interest in
    using spatial econometrics, specifically geographically weighted regression
    (GWR) to more accurately model housing prices. However, with many different
    existing GWR models, it is not very easy for the casual users to use one for
    analysis. Addressing this need, we designed and developed EzModel, a dynamic
    and interactive GWR modelling tool to help economists, planners,
    policymakers to explore and analyse how variations of features in the local
    surroundings, such as number of MRT/LRT stations around a HDB unit, may
    affect housing prices. As there may be certain factors that should be more
    accurately modelled as global factors, our tool also allows users to easily
    switch to a mixed geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model to model
    both local and global variables. The potential of EzModel is demonstrated
    through the use of robust GWR modeling options as well as interactive
    isoline maps to analyse the effects of local spatial variations on
    Singapore’s Housing Development Board (HDB) Flat resale prices.

    The technique of geographically weighted regression (GWR) is used to model
    spatial ‘drift’ in linear model coefficients. In this paper we extend the
    ideas of GWR in a number of ways. First, we introduce a set of analytically
    derived significance tests allowing a null hypothesis of no spatial
    parameter drift to be investigated. Second, we discuss ‘mixed’ GWR models
    where some parameters are fixed globally but others vary geographically.
    Again, models of this type may be assessed using significance tests.
    Finally, we consider a means of deciding the degree of parameter smoothing
    used in GWR based on the Mallows Cp statistic. To complete the paper, we
    analyze an example data set based on house prices in Kent in the U.K. using
    the techniques introduced.

    Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was developed in response to the
    ﬁnding that a regression model estimated over the entire area of interest
    may not adequately address local variations. The fairly simple principle on
    which it is based consists on estimating local models by least squares, each
    observation being weighted by a decreasing function of its distance to the
    estimation point. Combining these local models makes it possible to build a
    global model with speciﬁc properties. GWR can be used, in particular with
    the help of associated cartographic representations, to identify where local
    coefﬁcients deviate the most from the overall coefﬁcients, to build tests to
    assess whether the phenomenon is non-stationary and to characterise
    non-stationary. The method is presented using the example of a hedonic
    pricing model – prices of existing housing in Lyon. We show how to optimally
    determine the radius of the disk on which local regressions will be
    performed and we present the estimation results, the robust estimation
    methods and the tests of coefﬁcients’ non stationarity. In addition to this
    descriptive use, we present a more predictive approach, showing how taking
    non-stationarity into account makes it possible to improve an estimator over
    a spatial area. The example is based on a model linking the poor population
    and the number of beneﬁciaries of supplementary universal health coverage
    (CMU-C) in Rennes.
